Populate all the command-line in an \code{SYSargs2} object
}
\description{
The \code{SYSargs2} S4 class object is constructed from the \code{loadWorkflow}, which stores all the information and instructions needed for processing a set of input files with a specific command-line or a series of command-line within a workflow. The \code{renderWF} function populates all the command-line for each sample in each step of the particular workflow. Each sample level input/outfile operation uses its own \code{SYSargs2} instance. The output of \code{SYSargs2} define all the expected output files for each step in the workflow, which usually it is the sample input for the next step in an \code{SYSargs2} instance. Between different instances, this connectivity is established by writing the subsetting output with the \code{writeTargetsout} function to a new targets file that serves as input to the next \code{loadWorkflow} and \code{renderWF} call. By chaining several \code{SYSargs2} steps together one can construct complex workflows involving many sample-level input/output file operations with any combination of command-line or R-based software.
